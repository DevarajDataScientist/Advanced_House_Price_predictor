Machine Learning Project with ZenML and MLflow
This project uses ZenML to manage machine learning pipelines and MLflow for tracking experiments and deploying models. Below is the guide to set up the environment, run the pipeline, and deploy the model.

Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

Python: Version 3.7 or higher
Pip: Version 20 or higher
Installation Instructions
1. Install ZenML
To install ZenML, follow the official ZenML installation guide:

ZenML Installation Guide
Alternatively, you can install ZenML directly using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install zenml
2. Create a Virtual Environment
Create and activate a Python virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies. You can follow the tutorial here: Create Virtual Environment.

For Windows (Command Prompt):
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
For Windows (PowerShell):
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
For Linux/macOS:
bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install Required Dependencies
After activating the virtual environment, install all required dependencies from requirements.txt:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Install ZenML MLflow Integration
If you're running the run_deployment.py script, you need to install ZenML’s MLflow integration:

bash
Copy code
zenml integration install mlflow -y
5. Register ZenML Stack with MLflow
The project requires a ZenML stack with MLflow experiment tracker and model deployer. Follow these commands to set up the stack:

bash
Copy code
zenml experiment-tracker register mlflow_tracker --flavor=mlflow
zenml model-deployer register mlflow --flavor=mlflow
zenml stack register local-mlflow-stack -a default -o default -d mlflow -e mlflow_tracker --set
Running the Pipeline
To run the pipeline, you need to execute the run_pipeline.py script. This script handles the full pipeline execution using ZenML.

bash
Copy code
python run_pipeline.py
This will run the pipeline, executing all steps such as data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, depending on how the pipeline is configured.

Deploying the Model
To deploy the model using MLflow, run the run_deployment.py script. This script will deploy the model to the configured MLflow model server.

bash
Copy code
python run_deployment.py

Notes:
Ensure you have MLflow running if you're using the deployment functionality.
If you face any errors during installation or execution, verify that all dependencies are correctly installed and that the ZenML stack is properly configured.
